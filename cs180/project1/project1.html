    <h1>CS 180 Project 1</h1>
    <p>Name: Brandon Wong</p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of project 1 is to convert images taken with 3 separate color 
        channels taken by Prokudin-Gorskii in the 20th century 
        into a singular rgb color image with minimal leftover issues 
        from converting several different images into one. Because the images 
        were taken before color photos could be taken, they take the form 
        of 3 separate images that need to be aligned and cleaned up with 
        various computer vision techniques to convert them into modern 
        color images.
    </p>
    <h2>Alignment</h2>
    <h3>Splitting</h3>
    <p>
        Most of the images are split in one way. First, the original image is loaded 
        from the file. Then, this original image is cropped by two-thirds of a percent 
        on each side. After that, the separate channel images are split apart by taking 
        the first third, second third, and last third of the original image and assigning 
        them to blue, green, and red respectively. This channel images are then cropped 
        by five percent on each side to obtain the final blue, green, and red channel images.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is one exception to this. The cathedral image isn't cropped at all before being
        aligned. This is the original method I used for all the .jpg images, but I found that
        this caused issues for the monastery image so I stuck with the method I used for .tif
        images for all of the images except the cathedral image, where cropping caused issues 
        instead. As such, the cathedral image is the sole image that does not get cropped before
        alignment. Margins are instead removed after processing, which is already done anyways
        for all the jpg images.
    </p>
    <h3>Aligning</h3>
    <p>
        The channels are aligned by finding the L2 norm, also known as the Euclidian Distance, 
        of the red and blue images individually with the green image.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the case of the .jpg images, different paddings are applied to the red and blue images 
        before their Euclidean Distance with the green image is found. The paddings that result 
        in the smallest L2 norm are the ones selected to be used in the final alignment, and then 
        the margins are removed from the final image to keep just the aligned parts in the final 
        result.
