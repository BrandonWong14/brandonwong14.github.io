    <p>Name: Brandon Wong</p>
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
        The goal of project 1 is to convert images taken with 3 separate color 
        channels taken by Prokudin-Gorskii in the 20th century
        into a singular rgb color image with minimal leftover issues
        from converting several different images into one. Because the images
        were taken before color photos could be taken, they take the form
        of 3 separate images that need to be aligned and cleaned up with
        various computer vision techniques to convert them into modern
        color images.
